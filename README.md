# raynet Web UI

This repository contains the beginnings of the **raynet** messenger web UI. The layout and styles are based on the project's design specification which focuses on a monochrome palette and the "Inter" typeface.

Currently this prototype includes:

- A basic chat list and conversation window.
- Styles that define the core color palette and typography.
- A simple responsive layout for desktop and mobile.
